# An OpenGL template project

This project was made because i was tired of having to set up OpenGL each time i wanted to experiment with something.
No linking, no dependencies needed. Everything is included in the project with a few additional helper stuff/ experimental features.
This is not meant to be a game engine or even a proper renderer, just a playground.

It uses:
* Glad loader
* GLFW 
* glm
* Assimp (TODO)
* DearImgui (TODO)
